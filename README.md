# Note
I'm likely going to rework this project in the future, as this was a hodgepodge.
.
## Info
This was a project done for "paraller programmin" at Åbo Akademia, implementing the game of life and piping it to the console.
## Build
The project only uses OMP, but other than that this project uses base libraries and functions available to base c++ installation.

## Usage
Syntax for using the compiled thingamajig is -> ./*binary* [width] [height] [generations] [display_step] [num_threads] [seed]

If an value is not provided it defaults to a value, othervise you must provide arguments for each from left to right.
The display step can be left at 0 to avoid spamming grids to the terminal. The seed probably doesn't work.
