# Don't know what ye want here...
##Info
This was a project done for paraller programmin 2025 at Ã…bo Akademia. (Not a particularly good one though)
## Build
->Preferably build using Clion I guess.
-> you do need OMP, but other than that this project uses base libraries and functions available to base c++ installation.

## Usage
Syntax for using the compiled thingamajig is -> ./*binary* [width] [height] [generations] [display_step] [num_threads] [seed]

The display step can be left at 0 to avoid spamming grids to the terminal. The seed probably doesn't work.
